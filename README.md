Frontend Web Developer with a Focus on JavaScript | Enhancing Skills in Data Structures and Algorithms Using C++
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I am a passionate JavaScript developer with a keen interest in crafting dynamic frontend web applications. My journey in web development began in my first year of engineering, where I discovered a love for creating seamless user experiences. Currently, I am expanding my skills by delving into data structures and algorithms with C++, enhancing my understanding of computer science fundamentals. Beyond JavaScript, I have a diverse programming background, having explored languages such as Python, Go, and Java. I'm also immersing myself in Linux, computer networking, and operating systems to gain a deeper understanding of the tech ecosystem. I am particularly fascinated by low-level programming and am continually seeking opportunities to apply my knowledge in real-world projects. I thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy sharing my learning journey publicly on platforms like LinkedIn and Twitter. As an ambitious and eager learner, I am excited to explore paid internships and job opportunities in tech companies where I can contribute and grow.
